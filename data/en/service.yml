    - name: "Safe for Production"
      icon: "ti-layout"
      content: |
        - Automated fail-over to on-demand within each AutoScaling Group
        - Mature (4+ years old), production-grade software (>80% unit test coverage), used at hundreds of companies of all shapes and sizes
        - Simple in operation, essentially just replaces EC2 instances with spot clones
        - Best effort, keeps infrastructure as-is in case of most failures
        - Configurable to keep some amount of on-demand instances in each ASG
        - Automated traffic draining for instances behind ELBs
        - Supports termination lifecycle hooks
        - Can be enabled/suspended on a schedule

    - name: "Minimal Friction"
      icon: "ti-world"
      content: |
        - Installs in minutes using CloudFormation, Terraform or even as Docker container
        - Requires minimal infrastructure changes, just tag your existing long-running AutoScaling
          groups(ASGs) and it will gradually swap their instances with much cheaper identically configured Spot clones
        - Configuration overrides per ASG basis using additional tags offering flexibility
        - Can be mass-deployed on entire AWS Organizations using CloudFormation StackSets
        - Within an account can be configured to opt-out mode to adopt it on all but few disabled ASGs
        - Fully Automated bid price calculation and instance type selection

    - name: "Supported"
      icon: "ti-blackboard"
      content: |
        - Easy to install, stable, tested and supported binaries are available from the AWS Marketplace for less than 5% of the generated savings
        - Setup help and long-term support are covered
        - Vibrant Open Source community if you opt not to use the recommended support plan

    - name: "Secure"
      icon: "ti-palette"

    - name: "Compatible"
      icon: "ti-package"
      content: |
        - Out of the box support for most AWS services backed by AutoScaling groups, including but not limited to ECS, Kubernetes, Beanstalk
        - Easy to automate(suspend/resume) from CI/CD scripts

    - name: "Low cost overhead"
      icon: "ti-pulse"
      content: |
        - Negligible runtime costs (serverless)
        - Open Source code base
        - Convenient binaries that cost less than 5% of the generated savings are available on the AWS Marketplace.
        - No vendor lock-in, just uninstall it and your groups will eventually revert to fully on-demand.

    - name: "Simple by design"
      icon: "ti-pulse"
