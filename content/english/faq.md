## What is AutoSpotting?

AutoSpotting is a tool implementing an automated bidding algorithm against the
Amazon AWS EC2 spot market, which often gives you much cheaper spot instances,
allowing you to generate significant savings, often in the 70-90% range over
on-demand.

## What are spot instances, what is the spot market and how does it work?

Cloud providers such as Amazon AWS need to always have some spare capacity
available, so that any customer willing to launch new compute machines would be
able to do it without getting errors. Normally this capacity would be sitting
idle but still consuming power until someone needs to use it.

Instead of wasting this idle capacity, Amazon created a marketplace for anyone
willing to pay some money in order to use these machines, but knowingly taking
the risk that this spare capacity may be taken back within minutes when it needs
to be allocated to an ordinary on-demand user.

This is known as the *spot market*, and these volatile compute machines are
called *spot instances*.

The market automatically computes a price based on the current supply and
demand, updated daily, and everyone from the same AvailabilityZone (note:
availability zone names may not necessarily match between different AWS
accounts) within a region pays the same price for a given instance type.

Luckily the market price is most of the times a number of times less than the
normal, on-demand price, sometimes up to 10 times less, but usually in the 5x-7x
range. In many cases the spot capacity is so stable that spot instances may run
for weeks or even months at about 80% savings, so it's basically a waste of
money not to run spot instances there.

This sounds too nice to be true, and it almost is. In case of demand surges or
maintenance events in which some of the capacity is reclaimed. The spot
instances are terminated with a two minute notice when AWS needs that capacity
for on-demand users.

In those cases it would obviously be better to fall back to the normal on-demand
instances in order not to cause user impact for your application.

Since each availability zone and instance type combination has a different price
graph, in case one of them became too pricy and terminated all its instances, it
is possible to find another cheap one which may still run your workload, at
least for a while.

With enough redundancy(which should be in place anyway where it really matters),
a surprisingly large amount of applications are able to migrate the user traffic
to surviving machines in the event of spot instance terminations on some of the
availability zones.

One could generate a lot of savings if somehow could protect against these
unexpected terminations, like by quickly switching to another instance type or
even falling back to on-demand instances for relatively brief periods of time.

Autospotting is implementing exactly this kind of automation of switching
between different spot instance types, also falling back to on demand during
price surges.

## How does AutoSpotting work?

Normally the spot bidding process is static and can be done manually using the
AWS console, but since AWS exposes pretty much everything via APIs, it can also
be automated against those APIs.

AutoSpotting is a tool implementing such automation against the AWS APIs.

It monitors some of your AutoScaling groups where it was enabled and it
continuously replaces any on-demand instances found in those groups (it can also
keep some of them running) with compatible and identically configured spot
instances.

Alternatively you can also run it in `opt-out` mode to act on all the groups
from your AWS account, except for some it was blacklisted for. Some large
companies are using it in such a configuration even across hundreds of AWS
accounts to ensure the majority of their infrastructure to run on cost-effective
spot instances. If you are also considering such a rollout feel free to get in
touch on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cristim).

## How do I install it?

You can launch it using the provided CloudFormation stack. It should be doable
within a couple of minutes and just needs a few clicks in the AWS console or a
single execution of awscli from the command-line. The same CloudFormation stack
template can also be used for launching a StackSet against your entire AWS
organization.

You can see the Getting Started
[documentation](https://github.com/AutoSpotting/AutoSpotting/blob/master/START.md)
for more information on all these installation methods, as well as the initial
setup procedure.

## In which region should I install it?

For technical reasons, the CloudFormation installation only works with the
US-East region.

The community-supported Terraform stack can be launched in any AWS region.

You only need to install it once, at runtime it will by default connect across
all regions in order to take action against your enabled AutoScaling groups.
This is configurable in case you want to only have it running against a smaller
set of regions.

## How much does it cost me to run it?

AutoSpotting is designed to have minimal footprint, and it will only cost you a
few pennies monthly.

It is based on AWS Lambda, the default configuration is triggering the Lambda
function once every 5 minutes, and most of the time it runs for just a couple of
seconds, just enough to evaluate the current state and notice that no action
needs to be taken.

In case replacement actions are taken it may run for more time because the
synchronous execution of some API calls takes more time, but most of the times
it finishes in less than a minute. It should be well within the monthly Lambda
free tier, you will only pay a few cents for logging and network traffic
performed against AWS API endpoints.

The Cloudwatch logs are by default configured with a 7 days retention period
which should be enough for debugging, but shouldn't cost you so much. If
desired, you can easily configure the log retention and execution frequency to
any other values in the CloudFormation stack parameters.

## How about the software costs?

The software itself is free and open source so there it's entirely free if
you build the open source code straight from trunk, host it on your own
infrastructure and test it all yourself.

But as building it and setting it all up may take some time and effort, we also
have convenient to use evaluation binaries built straight from trunk. These are
free to use, can be installed in minutes but haven't been yet tested thoroughly
and expire after 30 days since being built.

If you don't want to take any chances or spend time testing the trunk builds
yourself, we also have supported prebuilt binaries that have been thoroughly
tested. These cost a small monthly fee but also support further development
of the software.

You therefore have the following options:

### Open source

- the source code is and will always be distributed under an MIT license, so
  anyone can build and run their own binaries free of charge on any number
  of AWS accounts.
- users can freely fork and customize the code, but these forks may be hard
  to maintain on the long term if they diverge consistently from mainline.
  Do yourself a favor and at least try to upstream your local changes.
- limited, best-effort community support, and no support whatsoever if you
  run a custom fork with private changes.
- the AutoSpotting name is also a registered trademark covering only the
  use in relation to the official binaries, the source code from the mainline
  git repository and its public forks made in the process of contributing code
  to this software. If you run custom binaries that were not created in order
  to contribute to the development effort, you must rename all occurences of
  "AutoSpotting" with something else in the code, infrastructure/configuration
  code and generated build artifacts.

### Evaluation binaries

- These are binaries and Docker images built from the git repository after each
  commit.
- They will save you the time needed to build the source code yourself from
  trunk, upload and host it on your own infrastructure.
- Expire after a month from being built, designed to help find issues with the
  latest code.
- These builds may sometimes be broken and barely tested. You will need to test
  the software yourself to make sure it works well from you.
- Limited, best-effort community support, and only if you can reproduce the
  problem with the latest build.

### Stable Proprietary binaries

- Carefully selected binaries that were tested and confirmed to work well, so
  you don't need to test them yourself.
- Come with installation help, long term enterprise support and notifications
  over a private channel when a newer stable version is available. These
  notifications are only given to the stable build subscribers.
- Unlimited savings
- Licensed in a flat, inexpensive monthly subscription basis payable through
  [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/cristim).

### Exception for contributors

- Code contributors, people contributing testimonials or blogging about the
  project can use the stable binaries free of charge on any number of AWS
  accounts, for a year after their latest contribution to the project.
- You will need to get in touch on gitter and prove that you qualify for this,
  and will be given some special installation instructions.
- These don't include the enterprise support, but the limited, best-effort
  community support of the evaluation binaries.

## How do I enable it?

The entire configuration is based on tags applied on your AutoScaling groups.

By default it runs in `opt-in` mode, so it will only take action against groups
that have the `spot-enabled` tag set to `true`, across all the enabled regions.

When configured to run in `opt-out` mode, it will run against all groups
except for those tagged with the `spot-enabled` tag set to `false`.

Note: the keys and values of the tags, are configurable in both modes, and
multiple tags can be used

## What if I have groups in multiple AWS regions?

As mentioned before, the groups can be in any region, AutoSpotting will connect
to all regions unless configured otherwise at installation time.

The region selection can be changed later by updating the CloudFormation or
Terraform stack you used to install it.

Note: your license may sometimes only cover a subset of the regions. This is
not enforced in the software, but please pay attention in order not to violate
the license terms.

## Will it replace all my on-demand instances with spot instances?

Yes, that's the default behavior (we find it quite safe), but for your peace of
mind this is configurable, as you can see below.

## Can I keep some on-demand instances running just in case?

For your peace of mind, AutoSpotting can be configured to keep some on-demand
instances running in each of the enabled groups, if so configured.

On the enabled groups it will by default replace all on-demand instances with
spot, unless configured otherwise in the CloudFormation stack parameters. This
global setting can be overridden on a per-group level.

You can set an absolute number or a percentage of the total capacity, using
tags set on each group.

For more information about these tags, please refer to the Getting Started
guide.

## What does it mean "compatible"?

The launched spot instances can be of different type than your initial
instances, unless configured otherwise, but always at least as large as the
initial ones. You can also constrain it to the same type or a list of types,
also using the main configuration or some optional tag overrides on a per-group
level.

By large it means the launched spot instances have at least as much memory, disk
volumes(both size and their total number), CPU and GPU cores, EBS optimization,
etc. as the initial on-demand instance type.

The price comparison also takes into account the EBS optimization extra fee
charged on some instance types, so if your original instance was EBS optimized
you will still get an EBS optimized instance, and the prices are correctly
compared, taking the EBS optimization surcharge into account.

Often the initial instance type, or the same size but from a different
generation, will be the cheapest so it is quite likely that you will get at
least some instances from the original instance type, but it can also happen
that you get larger spot instances.

## How is the spot instance replacement working?

AutoSpotting will eventually run against your enabled group and notice that more
than configured on-demand instances are running there.

It will randomly pick an on-demand instance and initiate a replacement, by
launching a compatible spot instance chosen to be the cheapest available at that
time in the same availability zone as the on-demand instance selected for
replacement. The spot instance is configured identically to the original
instance, sharing the security groups, SSH key, EBS block device mappings, EBS
optimization flag, etc. This information is taken mainly from the group's launch
configuration, which is otherwise kept unchanged and would still launch
on-demand instances if needed.

The spot bid price is by default set to the hourly price of the original
on-demand instance type, but we have an aggressive bidding strategy that can set
a price close to the current spot price, in order to avoid significant increases.

The new spot instance will be tagged with the name of the AutoScaling group for
which it was launched, and the algorithm waits for the spot instance to be
launched. Once the spot instance resource was launched and became available
enough for receiving API calls, the instance is tagged to the same tags set on
the initial instance, then the algorithm stops processing instances in that
group. It does this in parallel over all your groups across all AWS regions
where it was configured to run.

On the next run, maybe 5 minutes later, it verifies if the launched spot
instance was running for enough time and is ready to be added to the group. It
currently considers the grace period interval set on the group and compares it
with the instance's uptime.

If the spot instance is past its grace period, AutoSpotting will attach it to
the group and immediately detaches and terminates an on-demand instance from the
same availability zone. Note that if draining connection is configured on ELB
then Auto Scaling waits for in-flight requests to complete before detaching the
instance. The terminated on-demand instance is not necessarily the same used
initially, just in case that may have been terminated by some scaling operations
or for failing health checks. But nevertheless, it will be picked from the same
Availability Zone in order to avoid rebalancing actions.

## What happens in the event of spot instance terminations?

Recent versions of AutoSpotting detect and process the termination notification
events.

The behavior in this case depends on your group's configuration. If you use a
termination Lifecycle Hook, the spot instance will be terminated immediately by
AutoSpotting, which will trigger the immediate execution of the Lifecycle Hook.
There you can take actions such as pushing log files to S3, draining ECS cluster
tasks, etc. and hopefully manage to drain it completely before it's forcefully
terminated by the spot market.

If the group has no termination Lifecycle Hook configured, the instance will be
detached from the group and left running until the spot market will eventuallly
terminate it. This will trigger its autmatic removal of the instance from the
load balancer.

Once the instance was terminated, your AutoScaling group's health checks will
eventually fail, and the group will handle this as any instance failure by
launching a new on-demand instance likely in the same availability zone as
initially configured on the group.

That on-demand instance will be replaced later on by AutoSpotting using the
normal replacement process described above.

## What bidding price does AutoSpotting use?

By default AutoSpotting is placing spot bids with the hourly price of your
original on-demand instances, so you never pay more than that in the event of
price surges.

Another bidding strategy is placing bids based on the current spot price, with a
bit of buffer (default 10%) on top of the current spot price. This will
terminate your spot instances on significant price increases, to give the
algorithm the chance to search for better priced instance types.

## What are the goals and design principles of AutoSpotting?

To paraphrase Rancher's motto: "Using Spot instances is hard, AutoSpotting makes
it easy"

AutoSpotting is designed to be used against existing AutoScaling groups with
long-running instances, and it is trying to look and feel as close as possible
as a native AWS service. Ideally this is how the AutoScaling spot integration
should have been implemented by AWS in the first place.

It's also meant to be rolled out at scale, such as across entire AWS
organizations, where it can sometimes be executed in opt-out mode, converting
the entire fleet to spot instances.

Once installed and set up, it hopefully becomes invisible, both from the
configuration management perspective but also from the incurred runtime costs,
and security perspective.

The configuration is designed to be minimalist and everything should just work
without much tweaking. You're not expected to need to determine which instance
types are as good as your initial ones, which instance type is the cheapest in a
given availability zone, which price to bid and so on. Everything should be
determined based on the original instance type using publicly available
information and querying the current spot prices in real time. Your main job is
to make sure your application can sustain instance failures, and to configure a
draining action suitable for your application and environment if you do need
one.

It also tries as much as possible to avoid locking you in, so if you later
decide that spot instances aren't for you and you want to disable it, you can
easily do it with just a few clicks or commands, and immediately revert your
environment to your initial on-demand setup, unlike most other solutions where
the back-and-forth migration effort may become quite significant. You can even
enable/disable it on a one-off or scheduled basis, if you have such a use case.

From the security perspective, it was carefully configured to use the minimum
set of IAM permissions needed to get its job done, nothing more, nothing less.
There is no cross-accounting IAM role, everything runs from within your AWS
account and no information about your infrastructure ever leaves your AWS
account unless you maybe ship its logs yourself to a CloudTrail S3 bucket.

## What is the use case in which AutoSpotting makes most sense to use?

Any workload which can be quickly drained from soon to be terminated instances.

AutoSpotting is designed to work best with relatively similar-sized, redundant
and somewhat long-running stateless instances in AutoScaling groups, running
workloads easy to transfer or re-do on other nodes in the event of spot instance
terminations.

Here are some classical examples:

- Development environments where maybe short downtime caused by spot
  terminations is not an issue even when instances are not drained at all.
- Stateless web server or application server tiers with relatively fast response
  times (less than a minute in average) where draining is easy to ensure
- Batch processing workers taking their jobs from SQS queues, in which the order
  of processing the items is not so important and short delays are acceptable.
- Docker container hosts in ECS, Kubernetes or Swarm clusters.

Note: AutoSpotting implements some termination monitoring and draining logic
which can be extended if you use termination lifecycle hooks.

## What are some use cases in which it's not a good fit and what to use instead?

Anything that doesn't really match the above cases:

### Groups that have no redundancy

If you have a single instance in the group, spot terminations may often leave
your group without any nodes. If this is a problem, you should not run
AutoSpotting in such groups, but instead use reserved instances, maybe of T2
burstable instance types if your application works well on those.

### Instances which can't be drained quickly

If your application is expected to serve long-running requests, without timing
out after longer than a couple of minutes, AutoSpotting(or any spot automation)
may not be for you, and you should be running reserved instances.

### Cases in which the order of processing queued items is strict

Spot instance termination may impact such use cases, you should be running them
on on-demand or reserved instances.

### Stateful workloads

AutoSpotting doesn't support stateful workloads out of the box, particularly in
case certain EBS persistent volumes need to be attached to running instances.

The replacement spot instances will be started but they will fail to attach the
volume at boot because it is still attached to the original instance. Additional
configuration would have to be in place in order to re-attempt the attach
operation a number of times, until the previous on-demand instance is terminated
and the volume can be successfully attached to your spot instance. The spot
instance's software configuration may need to be changed in order to accommodate
this EBS volume.

## How does AutoSpotting compare to the the legacy AutoScaling spot integration?

Or why would I use AutoSpotting instead of the normal AutoScaling groups which
set a spot price in the launch configuration or the mixed groups?

The answer is it's more reliable than the legacy spot AutoScaling groups,
because they are using a fixed instance type so they ignore any better priced
spot instance types, and they don't fallback to on-demand instances when the
market price is higher than the bid price across all the availability zones, so
the group may be left without any running instances.

AutoSpotting-managed groups will out of the box launch on-demand instances
immediately after spot instance terminations and AutoSpotting will only try to
replace them with spot instances when compatible instances are available on the
market at a better price than those on-demand instances. The spot capacity is
still temporarily decreased during the price surge for a short time, until your
on-demand instances are launched and configured, but the group soon recovers all
its lost instances.

On top of that, Autospotting allows you to configure the number or percentage of
spot instance that you tolerate in your ASG, while the legacy integration of AWS
would try to replace them all, causing potential downtime if they were to
terminate at the same time.

## How does AutoSpotting compare to the AutoScaling mixed groups?

AutoSpotting is much like the relatively new mixed groups feature, but it still
has some unique capabilities:

- automated fail-over to on-demand instances when spot capacity is unavailable
  and back to spot soon after the spot market conditions improve
- you can enable/disable it at will from CI/CD pipelines and even on a schedule
  basis
- you can roll it out across your entire fleet in opt-out mode, without any
  configuration changes, in particular you don't need to convert your groups to
  LaunchTemplates
- out of the box support for ElasticBeanstalk environments
- out of the box handling of spot instance termination notifications
- flexible/automated instance type selection for spot instances

To be fair it also does have a few drawbacks (some currently being worked on):

- the increased churn caused by the instance replacement process
- lack of support for launch lifecycle hooks
- no support for the AWS regions located in China
- no support for GovCloud
- some maintenance costs, as well as small runtime costs
- potential software costs if you don't build it from the open source code
  yourself

## How does AutoSpotting compare to the spot fleet AWS offering?

Or why would I use AutoSpotting instead of the spot fleets? And when would I be
better off running spot fleets?

The spot fleets are groups of spot instances of different types, managed much
like AutoScaling groups, but with a different API and configuration mechanism.
Each instance type needs to be explicitly configured with a certain bid price
and weight, so that the group's capacity can be scaled out over various instance
types.

These groups are quite resilient because they are usually spread over multiple
spot instance types, so it's quite unlikely that the price will surge on all of
them at once. But much like the default AutoScaling spot mechanism they are also
unable to fall back to on-demand capacity in case the prices surge across all
their instance types. AutoSpotting will also try to avoid using all instances of
the same type, in many cases, with enough capacity by spreading over three or
four different spot market price graphs, which in addition to the on-demand
fallback capability should be also quite resilient in the event of spot
terminations.

Also the SpotFleet configuration mechanism is quite complex so it's relatively
hard to migrate to/from them if you already run your application on AutoScaling
groups, which is trivial to do with AutoSpotting.

The SpotFleets are also much less widely used than the AutoScaling groups, and
many other AWS services and third-party applications are integrated out of the
box with AutoScaling but not with SpotFleets. Things like ELB/ALB,
[CodeDeploy](CODEDEPLOY.md), and Beanstalk would run pretty much out of the box
on AutoScaling groups managed by AutoSpotting, while integrating them with
SpotFleets may need additional work or would simply be impossible in their
current implementation. People also tend to be much more familiar with the
AutoScaling group concept, which is easier to grasp and makage by developers
which have more limited exposure with AWS.

Spot Fleets are great for use cases in which the instance type is not important
and can vary widely, or workloads can be somehow scheduled on certain instance
types, like for example in case of ECS clusters.

AutoSpotting, on the other hand will try to keep the instances relatively
consistent with each other, so instances will be in a narrower range than
usually configured on the spot fleets. This is a consequence of the current
implementation which doesn't have any weighting mechanism, so in order to
meaningfully scale capacity with the same AutoScaling policies, the instances
have to be roughly of the same size. The original on-demand price used for spot
instance bidding will also constrain the spot instance types to a relatively
narrow range, which is not the case for SpotFleets.

## How does AutoSpotting compare to commercial offerings such as SpotInst?

Many of these commercial offerings have in common a number of things:

- SaaS model, requiring admin-like privileges and cross-account access to all
  target AWS accounts which usually raises eyebrows from security auditors. They
  can read a lot of information from your AWS account and send it back to the
  vendor and since they are closed source you can't tell how they make use of
  this data. Instead, AutoSpotting is launched within each target account so it
  needs no cross-account permissions, and no data is exported out of your
  account. Also since it's open source you can entirely audit it and see exactly
  what it does with your data and you can tweak it to suit your needs.
- Implement new constructs that mimic existing AWS services and expose them with
  proprietary APIs, such as clones of AutoScaling groups, maybe sometimes
  extended to load balancers, databases and functions, which expect custom
  configuration replicating the initial resources from the AWS offering. Much
  like with spot fleets, this makes it quite hard and work-intensive to migrate
  towards but also away from them, which is a great vendor lock-in mechanism if
  you're a start-up, but not so nice if you are a user. Many of these resources
  require custom integrations with AWS services, which need to be implemented by
  the vendor. Instead, AutoSpotting's goal is to be invisible, easy to install
  and remove, so there's no vendor lock-in. Under the hood it's all good-old
  AutoScaling, and all its integrations are available out of the box. If you
  need to integrate it with other services you can even do it yourself since
  it's open source.
- they're all pay-as-you-go solutions charging a percentage of the savings. For
  example spotinst charges 20% or often as much as you will pay AWS for spot
  instances, which I find obscene for how simple this functionality can be built
  in AutoSpotting. They justify this by nice looking dashboards and buzz words
  such as Machine Learning, but although that's nice to have, it's not really
  needed to implement this type of automation. Predicting the spot prices is
  hard so it's better to invest the time automating the draining process and
  making it faster to react when terminations happen. Their goal is to sell a
  product which has to look and feel polished enough for people to buy it.
  AutoSpotting's goal is to simply be useful, and as invisible as possible, also
  from the price persoective. If you need to see a saving dashboard, just wait
  for the end of the month and then look at the Bills section of the AWS
  console, or feel free to contribute implementation for one if you need it.
- From the functionality perspective they are indeed more feature-rich and
  polished than both AWS Spot Fleets and AutoSpotting, and they may be
  cloud-provider-agnostic, but their price tag is huge.

## How does AutoSpotting compare to commercial offerings such as Xosphere and MaxSpotter?

Both these commercial tools are based on the older MIT-licensed AutoSpotting
source code with a few additional closed-source extensions. So far none of them
has contributed anything back towards AutoSpotting development and they don't
give any credit in their marketing materials.

They operate similarly to AutoSpotting in many ways, so if you don't really need
their additional features it's relatively easy to migrate amongst them by
renaming the tags set on your AutoScaling groups, or you can even
re-configure/customize AutoSpotting to accept their configuration tags. Please
[get in touch](https://gitter.im/cristim) if you need help migrating from them
to AutoSpotting.

All in all you get many of the AutoSpotting benefits, but at a much higher cost
overhead. Below you can see a rough feature/cost comparison with both of them.

### Xosphere

Pros

- Offers native Kubernetes and ECS integration
- Supports attaching EBS volumes for stateful workloads
- Available on the AWS Marketplace
- Supports GovCloud
- Automatic diversification of spot instances
- Has a costs dashboard

Cons

- Lacking some recent developments in AutoSpotting since they forked the code
  back in 2018
- Charges 15-20% of savings depending on instance type and pricing model.
- There's no published formula on how to calculate your costs and they reserve
  the rights to change prices at a month notice, so you can't predict your costs
  in advance.

When to choose Xosphere over AutoSpotting

- you depend on their closed source additional functionality. Keep in mind that
  some of them are also doable with AutoSpottingbut might require additional
  effort.
- you have infrastructure in GovCloud
- their unpredictable and much higher costs are okay for you

### MaxSpotter

Pros

- User-friendly dashboard
- Uses machine-learning for preemptive shutdown of terminating instances and
  choosing instances with low interruption rates.

Cons

- Lacking some recent developments in AutoSpotting since they forked the code
  back in 2019
- Charges 50% of savings(Professional plan)

When to choose MaxSpotter over AutoSpotting

- you depend on their closed source additional functionality
- their much higher cost overhead is not a concern for you

## Does AutoSpotting continuously search and use cheaper spot instances?

If I attach autospotting to an AutoScaling group that is 100% spot instances,
will it autobid for cheaper compatible ones when found later on?

The answer is No. The current logic won't terminate any running spot instances
as long as they are running, and since they are using the on-demand price as bid
value they may run for a relatively long time while other cheaper spot instance
may become available on the market. The only times when AutoSpotting interacts
with your instances is at the beginning, after scaling actions or immediately
after spot instances are terminated and on-demand instances are launched again
in the group.

## The lambda function was launched but nothing happens. What may cause this?

I have a couple of on demand instances behind an asg configured with the
required tags but still no spot instance is bieng launched. What is the problem?

Have a look at the logs for more details.

Spot instances may fail to launch for a number of reasons, such as market
conditions that manifest in high prices across all the compatible instance
types, but also known bugs or limitations in the current implementation, which
would need to be fixed or simply implemented. If you are impacted by such issues
please report it on GitHub or consider
[contributing](https://github.com/AutoSpotting/AutoSpotting/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
a fix.

## Which IAM permissions does AutoSpotting need and why are they needed?

Just like users who pipe curl output into their shell for installing software
should carefully review those installation scripts, users should pay attention
and audit the infrastructure code when launching CloudFormation or Terraform
stacks available on the Internet, especially in case they are given significant
permissions against the AWS infrastructure.

AWS is quite helpful and by default it forbids installation of stacks which have
the potential to be used for escalation of privileges, but it turns out
AutoSpotting needs such permissions in order to work.

In order to launch the AutoSpotting stack, you will need to have admin-like
permissions in the target AWS account and you need to give the stack a special
permission, called `CAPABILITY_IAM`, which is needed because the stack creates
additional IAM resources which could in theory be abused for privilege
escalation. You can read more about this in the official AWS
[documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#using-iam-capabilities)

The AutoSpotting stack needs this capability in order to create a custom IAM
role that allows the Lambda function to perform all the instance replacement
actions against your instances and autoscaling groups.

This configuration was carefully crafted to contain the minimum amount of
permissions needed for the instance replacement and logging its actions. The
full list can be seen in the Cloudformation stack
[template](https://github.com/cristim/autospotting/blob/master/cloudformation/stacks/AutoSpotting/template.yaml#L199),
but it basically boils down to the following:

- describing the resources you have in order to decide what needs to be done
  (things such as regions, instances, spot prices, existing spot requests,
  AutoScaling groups, etc.)
- launching spot instances
- attaching and detaching instances to/from Autoscaling groups
- terminating detached instances
- logging all actions to CloudWatch Logs

In addition to these, for similar privileges escalation concerns, the
AutoSpotting Lambda function's IAM role also needs another special IAM
permission called `iam:passRole`, which is needed in order to be able to clone
the IAM roles used by the on demand instances when launching the replacement
spot instances. This requirement is also pretty well
[documented](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/granting-permission-to-launch-ec2-instances-with-iam-roles-passrole-permission/)
by AWS.

Since AutoSpotting is open source software, you can audit it and see exactly how
all these capabilities are being used, and if you notice any issues you can
improve it yourself and you are more than welcome to contribute such fixes so
anyone else can benefit from them.

## Is the project going to be discontinued anytime soon?

No way!

The project is actually growing fast in popularity and there are no plans to
discontinue it, actually it's quite the opposite, contributions are accelerating
and the software is already quite mature after more than 3 years of constant
development.

New people install it every day, there are many hundreds of installations, if
not thousands(it's hard to estimate). Many people are already using it in
production, including on large scale installations with millions in yearly
savings.

The stable binaries are generating recurring income to the initial author, who
is this way incentivized to continue development. This has been growing fast
over the last year and is on track to keep growing as more people adopt it. If
you like this project please consider also signing up to a monthly subscription.

## How do I Uninstall it?

You just need to remove the AutoSpotting CloudFormation or Terraform stack.

The groups will eventually revert to the original state once the spot market
price fluctuations terminate all the spot instances. In some cases this may take
months, so you can also terminate them immediately, the best way to achieve this
is by configuring autospotting to use 100% on-demand capacity for a while before
uninstalling it.

Fine-grained control on a per group level can be achieved by removing or setting
the `spot-enabled` tag to any other value. AutoSpotting only touches groups
where this tag is set to `true`.

Note: this is the default tag configuration, but it is configurable so you may
be using different values.

## Shall I contribute to Autospotting code?

Of course, all contributions are more than welcome :-)
